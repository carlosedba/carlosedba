### Hi there 👋

I'm Carlos Eduardo and I've been coding since I was 10 years old, I work mainly with web stuff but I also have interest in game reverse engineering.

#### What's on my mind right now:

I have three libraries that I created and been using at work and personal projects that I'm preparing to publish publicly at npm.
One is a React forms library, another is an RPC-like Node.js client-server library and the last one is a React UI kit.
All three libraries will be published under the [Alya Labs organization](https://github.com/alyalabs) here on GitHub.

#### Facts about me:

🥇  At 17 years old, I represented my state (Paraná, Brazil) and won first place in Web Development at a national competition hosted by the [Brazilian National Confederation of Industry (CNI)](https://www.portaldaindustria.com.br/cni/en/about/)
<br>
🎓  I have a bachelor's in Information Systems (from the Pontifical Catholic University of Paraná - PUCPR)
<br>
🔈  I love music
<br>
🇧🇷  I'm brazilian and I currently live in Curitiba, Paraná

### Hi there 👋

I'm Carlos Eduardo and I've been coding since I was 10 years old, I work mainly with web stuff but I also have interest in game reverse engineering.

I have four libraries that I've created and been using at work and personal projects that I'm preparing to publish publicly at npm.
One is a React forms library, another is a RPC-like Node.js client-server library and the last one is a React UI kit.
All three libraries will be published under the [Alya Labs organization](https://github.com/alyalabs) here on GitHub.
